    <h1>Elmore Leonard's Bad Day</h1>

    <h2>Prologue</h2>

    <p>“Never open a book with weather,” Elmore Leonard intoned gravely, as storm-clouds gathered above him, menacing and ominous.</p>

    <p>“Avoid prologues!” he urged.</p>

    <p>He paused to adjust his glasses, peering down at his notes in front of him. Behind his pulpit, snow-capped and craggy mountains sat, big chunks of rock with white on them. Below him, a throng of people sat attentively, like a large gathering.</p>

    <p>“Never use a use a verb other than ‘said’ to carry dialogue,” he delivered plainly. He pushed his glasses up his nose again.</p>

    <p>“Never use an adverb to modify the verb ‘said’” he said knowingly.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, lightning zig-zagged across the sky, and there was a great thundering boom that followed it. It was thunder! The atmosphere was electric!</p>

    <p>There was a murmur from the crowd below. One man stood up and shouted, “Oh Lor'! The devil hisself come to take us all!” Elmore fixed the man with a glare until he sat down again.</p>

    <p>“Keep your exclamation marks under control!!" he bellowed, with remarkably controlled restraint.</p>

    <p>He cleared his throat and leaned forward, his hands gripping the pulpit like ten fingers holding on to a ledge of wood. This point needed to be made.</p>

    <p>Raising his finger to the angry sky, he said, “Never use the words ‘suddenly’ or ‘all hell broke loose!’”</p>

    <p>All hell broke loose. “Yee-haw!” shouted one gentleman, who was wearing a Stetson hat and Cowboy boots.</p>

    <p>Elmore nodded to himself. “Use regional dialect, patois, sparingly,” he spoke wisely.</p>

    <p>“Oi, mister! Wot's that then?” shouted a grubby street urchin, who was inexplicably nowhere near a street. He had hitched a ride on a hay cart yesterday to come to the mountains and listen to the great man speak.</p>

    <p>Elmore plunged on like morning coffee.</p>
    
    <p>“Avoid detailed descriptions of characters,” he thus announced truthfully. His voice echoed with the wisdom of his eighty years, which his face – aged like old parchment – and his eyes – grey, steely, knowing – reflected. He paused to stroke his grey-white silver beard. The skin on his hands was scrotum-wrinkly and gross but also made you think of wisdom.</p>

    <p>He gazed down at the crowd that had gathered before him in a group. They were standing underneath a hollow at the top of a hill. The hill was green because it was covered in grass. The pulpit had been placed at the edge of the clearing, which was fenced by trees that had very detailed and descriptive leaves, like in Tolkien.</p>

    <p>“Don't”, he paused, “go into great detail describing places and things.”</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, a bold eagle swooped out of the sky, its feathers fluttering like birds. It soared majestically, like an eagle, against the rain, which was now pouring and had been for a while. Lightning crashed and thunder flickered across the sky. The wind was howling, now, building to an impossible literary climax.</p>

    <p>The crowd gathered as Elmore shouted over the wind his final words.</p>

    <p>“Finally!” he boomed bastically. “Try! To! Leave out! The part! That readers! Try! And! Skip!”</p>

    <p>Shockingly, the lightning struck him.</p>
